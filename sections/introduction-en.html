    EVI is an extension to the W3C PROV ontology <b>[PROV-O]</b> which treats provenance of scientific results and claims as evidence in support of their correctnes. It is inspired by a large body of work in abstract argumentation frameworks <b>&#91;Baroni et al., 2010; Bench-Capon &amp; Dunne, 2007; Cayrol &amp; Lagasquie-Schiex, 2009; Clark et al., 2014; Dung, 1995; Dung &amp; Thang, 2018&#93;</b>, showing that the evidence for correctness (and challenes to correctness) of any findings can be represented as a directed acyclic support graph, an <i>Evidence Graph</i>. When combined with with a graph of challenges to statements, or their evidence, this becomes a bimodal argument graph <b>&#91;Cayrol &amp; Lagasquie-Schiex, 2009a, 2009b&#93;</b>.    
    <br><br>
    We have abstracted core elements of our micropublications model <b>&#91;Clark et al., 2014&#93;</b> to create EVI, an ontology of evidence relationships that extends the W3C Provenance ontology, PROV <b>&#91;Gil et al., 2013; Moreau et al., 2013&#93;</b>, to support specific evidence types found in biomedical publications, reasoning across deep evidence graphs, and propagation of evidence challenges deep in the graph, such as: retractions, reagent contamination, errors detected in algorithms, etc., disputed validity of methods, challenges to validity of animal models, etc. &#91;Al Manir &amp; Clark, in preparation&#93;. 
    <br><br>
    EVI is based on the fundamental idea that scientific findings or claims are not facts, but assertions backed by some level of evidence, i.e. they are defeasible components of argumentation. Therefore it focuses on the structure of evidence supporting and/or challenging the claim. Evidence in a scientific article is in essence, a record of the provenance of the finding.
